- `GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE` rectangle textures
- Source and target textures may exhibit highly different gamuts and filter response distributions, so we apply a histogram matching step in order to achieve a meaningful matching between target and source patches --> Match features as well?
- Prepare all rotations
- Scaling of target
- Normalization of template
