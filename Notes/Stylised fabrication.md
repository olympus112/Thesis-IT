[[Stylized fabrication.pdf]]

## Definition
Stylized fabrication are fabrication technologies that are used to create a stylistic representation of a digital shape.

## Types
Based on which phenomena that is abstracted.

**Shapes**
These modify a 3D shape into a simpler representation.
- Foldable patches
- Interlocking flat primitives
- Wires and rods

**Materials**
Use of special materials to get particular effects.

**Lighting and shadow**
Using geometry to create special lighting or shadow effects.
- Shadow design

**Decompositions**
Decompose a shape in a set of disjointed pieces. Completing the puzzle is part of the game.
- Generic pieces
- Predefined pieces
